# About Parkinson

Parkinson’s disease is a progressive disorder of the central  nervous system affecting movement and inducing tremors and causes stiffness. It has 5 stages to it and affects more than 1 million individuals every year in India. This is chronic and has no cure yet.It is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting dopamine-producing neurons in the brain.Research shows that 89 percent of people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) experience speech and voice disorders, including soft, monotone, breathy and hoarse voice and uncertain articulation. There are several reasons people with Parkinson’s disease have reduced loudness and a monotone, breathy voice. One reason is directly related to the disordered motor system that accompanies PD, including rigidity, slowness of movement and tremor. Another cause being a change in sensory processing that is related to speech.For this cause, we are going to use a dataset which is formed by the various attributes of voice, for the better prediction of Parkinson’s Disease.XGBoost is a new Machine Learning algorithm designed with speed and performance in mind. 

# About XGBoost Classifier

XGBoost stands for eXtreme Gradient Boosting and is based on the decision trees. In this project, we will import the XGBClassifier from the xgboost library; this is an implementation of the scikit-learn API for XGBoost classification.The final establishment of this machine learning model is done by the utilization of Python and Jupyter Notebooks for the better implementation purposes.

# Software Requirements

1. Python
2. Machine Learning

#   Sub-Components (Modules)
    1. Pandas
    2. Numpy
    3. Scikit-learn
    4. XGBoost
    5. Flask

# Steps of Execution

1. Pull the repository and go to the folder and install the requirements inside the requirements.txt file using the command:-
     pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Now open the ParkinsonDetector.py and run it.
3. It asks to upload an excel or CSV of patients, upload it.
4. It provides the results back to you in a downloadable Excel format.
